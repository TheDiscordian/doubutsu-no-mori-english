# Completion queue

## V1 Final

All tracked findings V1-01 through V1-29 have implementations. The
[human acceptance record](checkpoints/V1_HUMAN_ACCEPTANCE.md) closes every
reported V1-01 through V1-23 issue, the reported v0 corrections, and repeated
ordinary save/restart/reload. Do not reopen those accepted cases.

The complete development ROM is
`build/main-diagnostic-text-01/animal-forest-diagnostic-text.z64`. It retains
all RC8 content and adds the [thirteen diagnostic literals](checkpoints/MAIN_DIAGNOSTIC_TEXT.md).
That stage has passing focused checks, committed construction, and full UPS
reconstruction. No known tracked V1 finding awaits implementation.

The [V1 Final handoff](checkpoints/V1_FINAL_PACKAGE.md) is complete at
`build/v1-final/Animal Forest English V1 Final.z64`, with patch-only archive
`build/v1-final/V1-Final-patch.zip`. Three new package checks pass, and its own
standalone patcher recreates the complete final ROM. Preserve these results;
do not create more RCs, repackage without a change, or repeat final verification.
Existing RC artifacts and saves remain intact. Public publication approval and
the recorded redistribution decisions remain separate from the local handoff.

## Work that can change V1

- Fix concrete new text, layout, artwork, or gameplay defects when identified.
  Crashes, save damage, memory corruption, and blocked progression take priority.
- Preserve GameCube wording, intentional line/page breaks, and timing. Do not
  reflow dialogue broadly or redesign the accepted keyboard during finalisation.
- Keep the final package self-contained: offline patch instructions, sources,
  compiler/source guide, manifest, checksums, save/memory requirements, and
  explicit known limits. The source-build guide points to the final diagnostic
  suffix output, not the older correction-only directory.

Neutral tools, room surfaces, effects, and fish/insect artwork stay unchanged
unless actual lettering or a concrete translation defect is identified.
Broad inspection of those assets is not V1 work and does not delay the final
release. Preserve [completed artwork findings](ARTWORK_REMAINDER.md) without
repeating them. Lucky-bag Japanese decoration intentionally matches English GC
and the user's explicit choice; the shrine remains the native shrine.

## Verification boundaries

Use existing passing source/native evidence for unchanged code and resources.
Do not re-test old builds, launch the full historical construction chain, repair
old test fixtures, resume exhausted harnesses, or maintain the percentage tool
without a concrete current need. Preserve the actual historical full-suite
result; do not claim it passed.

The 61-stage base, 28-stage artwork, nineteen-stage correction, and final
data-only suffix have recorded construction evidence. The composed 109-stage
command is not presented as a newly executed end-to-end run. Package checks
target only the final artifact and its bundled patcher.

Source-identified V1-24 through V1-29 labels retain their recorded verification
limits. Do not enable debug controls, create a town, spawn items, delete Pak
data, or invoke save operations merely to inspect wording. Prior human
acceptance is not fresh execution of these additional labels.

Broader seasonal/event/travel/Pak combinations, individual dialogue layouts,
and ordinary appearance of both adapted festival-stall placements remain
human-playtest work. The controlled stall preview already passes. These
untested cases are not automatically passed, but they do not block the build
that enables further testing. The [validation record](VALIDATION.md) and
[bounded policy](V0_PLAN.md) preserve the evidence and safety requirements.

## Public publication

The source repository remains private. The [release checklist](RELEASE_PREPARATION.md)
and [provenance review](checkpoints/RELEASE_PROVENANCE_REVIEW.md) distinguish
technical readiness from redistribution rights.

- Preserve third-party attribution, licence exclusions, and actual input roles.
  Tooling licences and patch checks do not grant Nintendo-content permissions.
- Obtain the user's public-publication approval and resolve the recorded
  redistribution review before a public upload or repository visibility change.
- Publish only the approved patch package and accompanying documentation/hashes,
  never ROMs, input archives, extracted assets, saves, or emulator checkpoints.

## V2

The [N64-inspired keyboard](../specs/KEYBOARD_V2.md) stays deferred until V1 is
complete. Its grey N64-controller background, matching button art, and left
control-stick image must preserve V1's accepted sounds, key positioning,
proportional editing, N64 controls, and saved capacities.

## Evidence

Current artifacts are in [progress](PROGRESS.md). Exact implementation and
verification results are retained in [checkpoints](checkpoints/),
[the implementation record](PROGRESS_RECORD.md), and
[the queue record](WORK_QUEUE_RECORD.md). Historical instructions in those
records do not direct completed work to be repeated.
